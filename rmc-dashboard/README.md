# RMC Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project presents an RMC (Raw Material Cost) performance dashboard developed
using Excel and Power BI to monitor sales performance, cost behavior, stock risk,
write-offs, and operational efficiency. The dashboard supports management decision-
making by providing a consolidated view of cost drivers and inventory exposure
across manufacturing plants.

## Business Problem
The business required improved visibility into:
- Rising raw material costs relative to sales
- Monthly RMC trends and variances
- Stock aging and risk exposure across RM, WIP, FG, and SFG
- Write-offs, liabilities, and operational losses

The objective was to replace fragmented Excel reports with a single, interactive
dashboard for faster and more informed decision-making.

## Key Metrics & Insights
The dashboard tracks:
- Total Sales and RMC value
- RMC percentage and monthly trends
- Stock aging (Over 30 and Over 90 days)
- Risk stock and liability exposure
- Write-offs and operational loss drivers
- Forecasted RMC percentage

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data extraction, cleaning, validation, and preprocessing
- **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX measures, interactive dashboards, and visualization
- Pivot tables, Power Query, and KPI definitions

## My Role
- Extracted and cleaned raw financial and operational data using Excel
- Structured datasets and prepared them for Power BI modeling
- Created calculated measures and KPIs to track RMC performance
- Designed an executive-level Power BI dashboard with interactive filters
- Validated figures with finance and operations stakeholders
- Translated complex data into actionable business insights

## Outcome / Business Value
- Improved transparency into cost drivers and inventory risks
- Enabled quicker identification of high-risk stock and write-offs
- Supported forecasting and cost control discussions
- Reduced manual reporting effort and improved data consistency
